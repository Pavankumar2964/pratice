Here is a summary of the provided Expense Tracker project, including its functionality, code flow, and the specific functions used.

### **Project Summary**

This is a web-based **Expense Tracker** application that allows users to manage personal finances by tracking daily income and expenses. It uses **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for logic. A key feature is **Data Persistence**, utilizing the browser's `localStorage` to ensure data remains saved even after the page is refreshed.

### **Core Functionality**

* **Add Transactions:** Users can enter a description, amount, date, and category (e.g., Food, Travel, Income).
* **Live Summary:** It automatically calculates and displays total **Income**, **Expense**, and **Balance**.
* **Edit & Delete:** Users can modify existing entries or permanently remove them from the list.
* **Filtering:** A dropdown allows users to filter the list to show only specific categories (e.g., showing only "Travel" expenses).
* **Visual Feedback:** Income amounts are displayed in **green** and expenses in **red** for quick visual distinction.

### **Code Flow & Logic**

1. **Initialization:**
* On page load, the script retrieves the `transactions` array from `localStorage`. If no data exists, it starts with an empty array.
* The `render()` function is called immediately to populate the table with any saved data.


2. **Adding/Updating Data:**
* The `addTransaction` function listens for the form submit event.
* It validates inputs (checks for empty fields or negative amounts).
* **Logic:** It checks if `editIndex` is `null`. If it is, a new transaction is **pushed** to the array. If `editIndex` has a number (meaning the user clicked "Edit"), it **updates** the existing entry at that index instead of creating a new one.


3. **Rendering the View:**
* The `render` function clears the current list and loops through the `transactions` array.
* It applies a filter based on the dropdown menu selection (showing "All" or a specific category).
* It dynamically generates HTML rows (`<tr>`) and injects them into the table body.
* It simultaneously calculates the total income and expenses to update the summary box.

### **JavaScript Functions Breakdown**

| Function Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `saveToLocalStorage()` | serializes the `transactions` array into a JSON string and saves it to the browser's local storage. |
| `addTransaction(e)` | The primary handler for the form. It reads input values, constructs a data object, updates the array (add or edit), and resets the form. |
| `render()` | The main display logic. It filters data, calculates totals (Income/Expense/Balance), and updates the DOM (HTML table). |
| `editTransaction(index)` | triggered by the "Edit" button. It fills the input fields with the selected transaction's data and sets the global `editIndex` variable. |
| `deleteTransaction(index)` | triggered by the "Delete" button. It uses `.splice()` to remove the item at the specific index and saves the new state. |
