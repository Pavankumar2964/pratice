Project Name: To-Do List Application
Technologies Used:

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling & layout

JavaScript – Logic, DOM manipulation, Local Storage

Purpose of the Project:
This project allows users to add, view, edit, update, and delete tasks. All tasks are stored in the browser using Local Storage, so the data remains even after refreshing the page.

2. Main Functionalities of the Project

Add a new task

2️⃣ To-Do.css (Styling)

Styles the page layout, form, buttons, and table

Adds:

Background colors

Rounded borders

Controls visibility of Update button using display: none

3️⃣ To-do.js (Logic & Functionality)

This file controls the entire working of the application.

4. Variables Used
var gIndex = null;


Stores the index of the task currently being edited

var allTasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("tasks")) || [];


Holds all task objects

Loads saved tasks from localStorage when the page loads

5. Functions Used and Their Purpose
1️⃣ registerTask()

Purpose: Add a new task

How it works:

Reads values from input fields

Creates a task object

Pushes it into allTasks

Saves data to localStorage

Clears the form

Refreshes the table

allTasks.push(Tasks);
saveToLocalStorage();
displayTaskInTable();

2️⃣ displayTaskInTable()

Purpose: Display all tasks in table format

How it works:

Clears existing table rows

Loops through allTasks

Creates:

Table row

Edit button

Delete button

Appends rows to <tbody>

This function is also called:

On page load

After add, update, or delete

3️⃣ saveToLocalStorage()

Purpose: Save tasks permanently

localStorage.setItem("tasks", JSON.stringify(allTasks));


Converts array to JSON

Stores it in browser memory

4️⃣ deleteTask(index)

Purpose: Remove a task

How it works:

Removes the selected task using splice

Updates localStorage

Refreshes the table

5️⃣ editTask(index)

Purpose: Edit an existing task

How it works:

Stores the selected task index in gIndex

Loads task data into input fields

Shows Update button

Hides Add Task button

gIndex = i;

6️⃣ updateTask()

Purpose: Update edited task details

How it works:

Reads updated input values

Replaces task at gIndex

Saves changes

Refreshes table

Task is saved and displayed

✏ Editing a Task

7. Key Concepts Used

DOM Manipulation

Event Handling (onclick)

Arrays & Objects

Local Storage

Dynamic Table Creation

Conditional Button Visibility

8. Final Conclusion

This project is a fully functional CRUD-based To-Do Application that demonstrates:

Real-world JavaScript logic

Data persistence using Local Storage

Clean separation of structure, style, and logic

It is suitable for beginners to intermediate level and can be extended with:

Task status (completed/pending)

Search & filter

Due dates

React conversion (future upgrade)
