Here is a summary of the **Movie Search App** project, including its functionality, code breakdown, and execution flow.

### **1. Project Summary**

This is a web-based application that allows users to search for TV shows and movies. It utilizes the **TVMaze API** to fetch live data. When a user searches for a title, the app displays a responsive grid of movie cards. Each card features the show's poster and includes an interactive hover effect that reveals the show's title, streaming platform, and a direct link to the TVMaze page.

### **2. Functionality & Features**

* **Search Mechanism:** Users input a query. If the input is left empty, it defaults to searching for "marvel".
* **Dynamic API Fetching:** Data is retrieved asynchronously from `api.tvmaze.com`.
* **Responsive UI:** The results are displayed in a CSS Grid that adjusts automatically to the screen size (`script.js` inserts elements, `style.css` handles the grid layout).
* **Interactive Cards:**
* **Normal State:** Shows the movie poster.
* **Hover State:** A dark overlay slides up (CSS transition) displaying the Title, Platform (Network/Web Channel), and a "View Details" button.


* **Platform Detection:** The code intelligently checks if a show is on a TV Network (e.g., HBO) or a Web Channel (e.g., Netflix) and displays the correct one.

### **3. Functions Used**

Here is a breakdown of the specific JavaScript functions found in `script.js`:

#### **A. Event Listener (Anonymous Function)**

* **Trigger:** Attached to the `form` on `'submit'`.
* **Action:**
1. Prevents the page from reloading (`e.preventDefault()`).
2. Captures the user's input.
3. Sets a default query ("marvel") if the input is empty.
4. Calls the main data function `tvMazeApi(query)`.
5. Resets the form input field.



#### **B. `tvMazeApi(query)**`

* **Type:** `Async/Await` function.
* **Purpose:** Handles the networking.
* **Logic:**
* Uses `fetch()` to send a GET request to the TVMaze search endpoint.
* Awaits the response and converts it to JSON (`req.json()`).
* Passes the resulting array of data to `makeImages()`.



#### **C. `makeImages(movies)**`

* **Type:** DOM Manipulation function.
* **Purpose:** Renders the HTML cards on the screen.
* **Logic:**
1. **Clears previous results:** `container.innerHTML = ""` prevents new searches from stacking on top of old ones.
2. **Loops** through the `movies` array.
3. **Image Handling:** Uses a ternary operator to check if an image exists. If not, it assigns a placeholder URL.
4. **Platform Logic:** Checks `show.network.name`; if null, checks `show.webChannel.name`; otherwise defaults to "Not Listed".
5. **HTML Construction:** Creates a `div` with class `.movie-card` and injects the Image and the Info Overlay HTML.

### **4. Code Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Initialization:** The browser loads `movieFinder.html`. The CSS styles are applied (black background), and `script.js` is loaded.
2. **User Action:** The user types a movie name (e.g., "Batman") and clicks "Search".
3. **Event Trigger:**
* The `submit` event listener fires.
* The browser is told *not* to refresh.
* `tvMazeApi("Batman")` is called.


4. **Data Fetching:**
* The browser sends a request to `https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=Batman`.
* The API responds with raw data, which is parsed into a JavaScript Object (JSON).


5. **Rendering:**
* `makeImages` receives the list of Batman shows.
* It wipes any old search results.
* It generates a generic "Card" for every show found.
* It calculates which platform the show is on.
* It appends the finished card to the `.Image-container`.


6. **User Interaction:**
* The user hovers over a card -> CSS transforms translate the `.movie-info-overlay` upwards to reveal details.



### **Important Note on Missing Code**

In your `makeImages` function, there is this line:

```javascript
card.querySelector("img").addEventListener("click", () => {
    showMovieDetails(show);
});

```

**Issue:** The function `showMovieDetails(show)` is **not defined** in the provided `script.js`.
**Result:** If a user clicks the image (instead of the "View Details" link), the console will throw a `ReferenceError`, and nothing will happen. You should either remove this click listener or define the `showMovieDetails` function.

### **Next Step**

Would you like me to write the missing `showMovieDetails` function for you so the image click works (perhaps opening a modal or logging details)?
