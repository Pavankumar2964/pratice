       Here is a comprehensive summary and breakdown of the **Advanced Quiz App** project based on the files provided (`QuizApp.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`).

### 1. Project Summary

This is a dynamic, web-based quiz application. It allows a user to enter their name, take a 10-question quiz (fetched from an external API), and track their progress against a timer. The application persists data using the browser's **Local Storage** to maintain a leaderboard of player history and high scores even after the page is refreshed.

### 2. Core Functionality

* **Dynamic Content:** Questions are not hardcoded; they are fetched live from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com).
* **Timer System:** Users have a strict 10-second limit per question. If time runs out, the app automatically moves to the next question.
* **Immediate Feedback:** When an answer is clicked, the button turns **Green** (correct) or **Red** (wrong). If the user answers incorrectly, the correct answer is simultaneously highlighted.
* **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar fills up as the user advances through the quiz.
* **Leaderboard:** Saves the player's name and score to `localStorage`, displaying a history of past players and the all-time High Score.

### 3. How the Code Flow Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Initialization:**
* The app loads `QuizApp.html`. The global variable `players` is initialized by parsing data from `localStorage`.
* The user sees the **Enter Your Name** screen (`#nameSection`).


2. **Starting the Quiz:**
* The user enters a name and clicks "Start Quiz".
* `startQuiz()` is triggered. It validates the input, hides the name section, shows the quiz section, and calls `fetchQuestions()`.


3. **Fetching Data:**
* `fetchQuestions()` requests 10 questions from the API. Once received, it resets the score and index, then calls `loadQuestion()`.


4. **The Game Loop (Question Cycle):**
* **Load:** `loadQuestion()` displays the current question. It mixes the correct and incorrect answers into a random order and creates buttons for them.
* **Timer:** `startTimer()` begins a 10-second countdown.
* **Action:**
* **If User Clicks:** `checkAnswer()` stops the timer, validates the choice, updates the score, and waits 800ms before moving on.
* **If Time Expires:** The timer interval hits 0, clears itself, and forces `nextQuestion()`.




5. **Completion:**
* When `currentIndex` reaches the end of the question array, `finishQuiz()` is called.
* The final score is displayed, saved to the `players` array, and pushed to `localStorage`.
* The Leaderboard is updated to show the new ranking.

### 4. Key Functions Breakdown (`script.js`)

Here is a detailed look at the specific functions used to drive the application logic:

| Function Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`startQuiz()`** | Entry point. Reads the user's name, toggles the UI visibility from "Name Input" to "Quiz Mode," renders the current leaderboard, and starts the data fetch. |
| **`fetchQuestions()`** | Uses `fetch()` with `await` to get JSON data from `opentdb.com`. Stores the results in the `questions` array and starts the first question. |
| **`loadQuestion()`** | The primary render function. It: <br>

<br>1. Resets the timer.<br>

<br>2. Randomizes answer order (`Math.random() - 0.5`).<br>

<br>3. Dynamically creates buttons for options.<br>

<br>4. Updates the progress bar. |
| **`checkAnswer(selected, correct, btn)`** | Logic for validating input. It adds CSS classes (`.correct` or `.wrong`) to the buttons. If the answer is wrong, it loops through buttons to highlight the correct one automatically. |
| **`startTimer()`** | Sets an interval that runs every 1000ms, decrementing the `timeLeft` variable. If it hits 0, it clears the interval and calls `nextQuestion()`. |
| **`updateProgress()`** | Calculates the percentage of the quiz completed (`currentIndex / total`) and updates the CSS `width` of the `.progress-bar`. |
| **`finishQuiz()`** | Called when no questions remain. It hides the questions, displays the final score, saves the result to `localStorage`, and updates the UI. |
| **`renderLeaderboard()`** | Sorts the `players` array by score (descending) so the highest score is first. It then dynamically generates `<li>` elements to display the history. |
| **`restartQuiz()`** | Simply calls `fetchQuestions()` again to fetch a fresh set of questions and reset the game state (score = 0), allowing the user to play again immediately. |

### 5. Technical Stack

* **HTML5:** Structure of the app.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox for layout, colors for feedback, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Uses `async/await` for API calls, Arrow functions, and `localStorage` for data persistence.
