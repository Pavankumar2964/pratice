    Eenadu History:
    
     
    VOICE - speaking with every SUNRISE
    
    Before Eenadu and after Eenadu. Two phases in language news publishing. Eenadu was born out of an inherent need of Telugus for a newspaper in their own language - best reflecting their nuances, their concerns, their views. Today the newspaper of the telegus is Eenadu.
    
    More households in the state of Andhra Pradesh wake up to the Eenadu than any other news daily. The heart and soul of Andhra Pradesh, it enjoys a circulation of  16,56,933 copies (ABC Jan - Jun 2019) per day and is published simultaneously from 23 printing centers. Making it one of the largest circulated newspaper in the country.  
    Awake, arise, history is at your doorstep!
    On 10th August 1974, it all began. Eenadu was launched in Visakhapatnam and a new chapter in newspaper publishing and journalism was heralded in. It was a moment etched forever in memory, for the Telugus.
    
    
    Telugu and Telugus are dear to us
    
    Eenadu was conceived for Telugus. A newspaper which provided the latest news and best reflected their needs. From the first day to now, for Telugus there are two distinct phases in their lives - before Eenadu and after Eenadu.
    
    Early come, early read, early Eenadu
    
    Before the first rays of the sun kissed the night away, Eenadu was there. Telugu newspaper readers in Visakhapatnam and the neighboring districts got the latest news, the earliest.....
    
    The Common man, Eenadu's uncommon focus
    
    The common man is Eenadu's hero. His news, his needs are paramount in importance. Whether it is village news, local news, infact important city news, Eenadu brings it to his doorstep. And in spoken Telugu, in an idiom best understood by him.
    
    For investigative journalism we said Naandi
    
    The very concept of 'investigative journalism' entered the vocabulary of the Telugu reader via Eenadu. First to introduce this concept, it was Eenadu's pioneering strides to investigate and report that gave news wholesomeness and depth.
    
    Triumphantly into Hyderabad
    
    16 months after the Vizag edition, the signs of times pointed to Hyderabad. And so it was that in 1975 on Dec. 17th, Eenadu gave a new ray of hope and expectation to newspaper readers. At last, here was a newspaper that Telugus in Hyderabad could call their very own.....
    
    Everything Eeandu touches, it changes
    
    And what a change the complete distribution of a newspaper saw with Eenadu. To reach the remotest places, Eenadu deployed its own vehicles. What's more, any one who was motivated enough to give the Telugus a path breaking
    newspaper was enrolled as an agent. Those who were ready to distribute even less than 10 copies were welcomed. In some places where buses don't reach, Eenadu does! 26,000 villages, all the towns and cities of AP, select regions outside the state - all covered through 8,500 agents, 362 days a year!
    
    Vijayawada's call for Eenadu to be victorious
    
    As the river Krishna gently flowed by, on the eventful day of May 1st, 1978, Eenadu entered Vijayawada. With this step came another 'first' - a newspaper getting simultaneously published from three places, Eenadu from Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Vijayawada. 
    
    No.1, always an Eenadu number
    
    All it took was four years for Eenadu to become the No.1 daily newspaper in Andhra Pradesh. The secret to being on the top, is Eenadu's love for Telugus and Telugu. Their aspirations, their causes, their language are Eenadu's inspiration and path to pre-eminence.
    
    My district, my news, my newspaper
    
    Recognizing this latent need, Eenadu brought in a product innovation - for every district its own newspaper. The district's news, events, views were given the importance they richly deserved. Thus were born 30 district, city newspapers in a multicolor tabloid form. Such a landmark change was for the first time in the world.
    
    First into Rayalaseema, first with fresh news
    
    Rayalaseema Telugu readers never looked back after June, 20th 1982. On this momentous day, Eenadu's Tirupati edition entered their lives with fresh news and in their spoken language.
    
    Coming home to Telangana
    
    Eenadu Karimnagar edition was launched in 1992. With this
    Karimnagar and the surrounding districts got the latest news. Without
    waiting or needing to depend on the newspaper to come from Hyderabad city.
    
    Classifieds in every district, a class creation
    
    With Eenadu, classifieds no longer remained confined to major cities. A unique product innovation, readers in most districts got their very own classifieds column. An 'Eenadu feature' that benefited them like never before.
    
    Sunday is Eenadu day !
    
    Sundays got transformed and a stir was created with the never before
    Eenadu Aadivaram. A special Sunday magazine, specially created for the Telugu readers. Eenadu Aadivaram was a 32 page magazine with 16 colour pages. Wholesome, entertaining and informative. A cover story for the weekend, articles and views that best reflected Telugu tastes. Uncommon and unusual people, events, anecdotes were also Aadivaram's forte. And the icing was of course Aadivaram becoming a springboard for story writers.
    
    A tribute to womanhood
    
    In september 1992, Vasundhara, a separate section came into women's
    lives. With a goal to mirror their world. And a desire to be their best friend by being informative, earnest and interesting. With Vasundhara, for the first time in India there was a supplement dedicated to women. Today Vasundhara is virtually the heartbeat of the Telugu woman.
    
    The excitement of getting a tip from the 'Nazrana' column, pouring their woes
    out to 'Dear Vasundhara,' or moving up the fashion orbit with 'Fashion - Fashion,' all are Vasundhara's unique offerings. Firmly rooted in the woman's world, Vasundhara lends a fresh touch to issues related to them. Discussions, essays, stories, titbits, advice from the casual to serious matters - What a woman wants, Vasundhara gives.....
    
    Pratibha, every day for students
    
    From 1989 January, students have been meeting their needs with the
    unique Pratibha. Filling in the role of an information provider and guide, Pratibha gives information on education, careers with all their twists & turns and the efforts that are required to make it big in life. Course details, model question papers, regular columns on counseling are what the Pratibha readers get. In fact, the yeoman effort of Eenadu with Pratibha has also been recognised by several educational institutions, educationalists and more.
    
    Common man takes stock !
    
    Common man got a share of his choice, courtesy the 'Business' page
    of Eenadu. For the first time here was a language daily which provided the
    stock-listing. And of course all the tips, details, pros and cons to stay in business.
    Shares, stock markets, economy, savings all were there in Eenadu's ' Business ' page.
    
    Farmer is the King
    
    The recognition of this truth is Eenadu's ' Raithay Raju.' Launched in 1985, August, it has evolved into a bridge to the farmer and his world. A path for him to harvest happiness. Farmer's issues were given prominence for the first time ever with the pioneering 'Raithay Raju.' Scientific practices, crop-related advice, new opportunities, expert opinions - modern, contemporary counsel was just a newspaper away with Eenadu.
    
    We'll tickle your ribs and your mind !
    
    Ask any Eenadu reader and rest assured the day's cartoon will be a topic of discussion, thought and smile. Empowering the art of cartooning with ' Eenadu touch ', the cartoons in Eenadu give the day's moment, political highlight, social highlight - all to the common man's delight. It's no surprise that many readers don't feel complete without Eenadu's daily dose of cartoons!
    
    RETA, a big benefit for small businesses
    
    When small businesses cannot afford big budgets in creating advertising, Eenadu is there. A value addition and an ' Eenadu extra ', the RETA (Retail Advertising) service conceptualizes and designs the advertising, and subsequently releases the same. RETA is a pioneering Eenadu effort to grow the potential of small businesses. Help them, guide them and make their rupee work harder.
